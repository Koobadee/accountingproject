# Accounting Project

Unadjusted Trial Balance - https://rpubs.com/kubackidave/1301450

This project simulates the accounting processes of a fictional food manufacturing company. I’m building it to practice and showcase my accounting skills while experimenting with programming. The code generates random transaction datasets, which I code into a general ledger and use to create financial statements. 
As an ongoing project, I’ll continue adding new scenarios to deepen my accounting knowledge. Feel free to explore or share, as this could be a useful exercise for others learning accounting.

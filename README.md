# Accountingproject
This is an accounting project I am doing of a fictional food manufacturing company.

I am building this project as a means of not only showcase and practice my accounting knowledge, but also to have some fun with programming while building this. I hope you enjoy.

Within this project, I will be building code which will randomly generate datasets to build financial statements.

This is an ongoing project where I will build in more fictional scenarios to help practice my accounting knowledge.

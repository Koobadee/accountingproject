# Accounting Project
This is an accounting project I am doing of a fictional food manufacturing company.

I am building this project to not only showcase and practice my accounting knowledge, but also to have some fun with programming while building this. I hope you enjoy.

Within this project, I will be building code which will randomly generate datasets that I will code and enter into a general ledger and build financial statements with.

This is an ongoing project where I will build more fictional scenarios to help practice my accounting knowledge. 

Feel free to share as I believe this exercise could help others learning about accounting as well.
